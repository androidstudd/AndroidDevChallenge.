The feature focuses on the most vulnerable part of our society. Our future building blocks, the KIDS. No matter what language we speak, which part of the globe we belong to but when it comes to our children we have a common mindset. They should not learn/say or even hear  bad, cuss words at a certain stage of life. 

Idea is to mute these words if kids are watching something which is not U rated. Machine Learning can help us identify these words by listening to speech/audio and beep(mute) them.. By just toggling, we can make any video content kids safe. We are already on our way where we can interpret speech in any language using Google Translate. This feature would be an extension which can be used as an accessibility.

This idea got triggered in my mind while watching an action hollywood movie. My child who is 1yr and 6 months was sitting next to me. All of a sudden I thought what would happen if she starts speaking like this using all bad words. 
Regarding the project, currently it’s an idea in mind. Google can help achieve this in reality by using translate api which will help us translate/interpret words with are considered as bad in any language. This can further be extended in multiple languages. 
Pre defined words in database can help us identify bad words in audio. Comparing it can help us muting the audio at that time. We can further use srt files also to track words in video.
